# QuantumSVM
This repo introduces a web-based application acting as a tool for data preprocessing and classification in quantum machine learning environments. In particular, the proposed tool uses evolutionary prototype selection and PCA-based feature extraction so as to try to minimize the size of data and enable a more accurate classification performed by a quantum SVM algorithm run on processors belonging to the IBM Q family.

This plataform was born as the collaboration between the computer science departament of Salerno and University of Naples, Federico II. In particual this project was develeoped as a final project thesis during my bechelor's degree in computer science.
